A production-ready, scalable distributed task queue system built with Python, featuring priority-based scheduling, automatic retries, dead letter queues, and REST API access. Designed to handle high-throughput workloads with reliability and observability at its core.

## 🎯 Project Overview

DistributedQ is a modern task queue implementation that solves real-world challenges in distributed systems:

- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: Decouple task submission from execution for better system resilience
- **Priority-Based Execution**: Critical tasks get processed first, ensuring business-critical operations aren't delayed
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff and dead letter queue for failed tasks
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Add workers dynamically to handle increased load
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect downstream services from being overwhelmed
- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring and metrics for production environments

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core Queue System
- **Thread-Safe Priority Queue**: Heap-based implementation with O(log n) insertion/removal
- **Delayed Task Execution**: Schedule tasks for future execution with millisecond precision
- **Backpressure Handling**: Configurable queue size limits to prevent memory overflow
- **Rate Limiting**: Control task processing rate to protect downstream services

### Worker Architecture
- **Concurrent Processing**: Thread pool-based workers for optimal CPU utilization
- **Dynamic Worker Scaling**: Add/remove workers at runtime based on load
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Workers complete in-flight tasks before terminating
- **Task Type Routing**: Different handlers for different task types

### Reliability Features
- **Automatic Retries**: Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Capture and analyze permanently failed tasks
- **At-Least-Once Delivery**: Ensures tasks aren't lost during failures
- **Visibility Timeout** (Stage 2): Automatic task recovery on worker failure

### REST API
- **FastAPI-Powered**: Modern, fast, and fully documented API
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Interactive API documentation at `/docs`
- **Task Management**: Submit, query, and manage tasks via REST
- **Worker Control**: Start, stop, and monitor workers through API
- **Health Checks**: Production-ready health and readiness endpoints

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Design Patterns Used
- **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: Decouples task submission from processing
- **Thread Pool Pattern**: Efficient resource utilization for concurrent processing
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable task handlers for different task types
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** (Planned): Protect against cascading failures

### Performance Characteristics
- **Throughput**: 1000+ tasks/second (in-memory mode)
- **Latency**: < 10ms task submission time
- **Concurrency**: Configurable worker pools (default: 5 workers/pool)
- **Memory Efficient**: O(n) space complexity for n tasks

### Code Quality
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotations for better IDE support and maintainability
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests with pytest
- **Documentation**: Detailed docstrings and API documentation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with modular design

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/distributedQ.git
cd distributedQ

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the API Server

```bash
python run_api.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
- Interactive docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Health check: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`

### 2. Submit a Task via API

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "priority": 1,
    "payload": {
      "type": "simple",
      "data": "Process this task"
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Using Python Client

```python
from distributed_queue.core.hybrid_queue import HybridQueue, StorageBackend
from distributed_queue.core.queue import Task
from distributed_queue.core.worker import Worker, WorkerConfig

# create queue with visibility timeout
queue = HybridQueue(
    backend=StorageBackend.MEMORY,  # or StorageBackend.REDIS
    max_size=1000,
    rate_limit=100,
    visibility_timeout=300.0
)

# create and configure worker
config = WorkerConfig(name="worker-1", max_workers=5)
worker = Worker(queue, config)

# register task handler
def process_task(data):
    print(f"Processing: {data}")
    return f"Completed: {data}"

worker.register_handler("simple", process_task)

# submit task
task = Task(priority=1, payload={"type": "simple", "data": "Hello World"})
queue.put(task)

# start processing
worker.start()
```

## 📊 API Endpoints

- Set an API key: `export API_KEY=your-secret`
- Include header on protected requests: `X-API-Key: your-secret`
